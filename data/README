Get the data from http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/GRT_GTFSdata.asp
or perhaps http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/agency/grand-river-transit/ .

Unpack into for example GRT-transit-20110904, and then cd into the sqlite3 directory
at the level of this README, delete GRT.db*, and run:

$ ../../bin/mksql3db.sh GRT.db ../GRT-transit-20110904/*

Note that it will warn you about the database version. This must be
bumped in the code for each new db (the DB_VERSION value).

That will produce GRT.db - and a bunch of split files. Remove anything in
../../Android/assets/databases/, and then

$ mv GRT.db.* ../../Android/assets/databases/

The app can then rebuild its database from that, as long as the database version has been
bumped in the code.
