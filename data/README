Get the data from http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/GRT_GTFSdata.asp
or perhaps http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/agency/grand-river-transit/ .

Unpack into for example GRT-transit-20110904, and then cd into the sqlite3 directory
at the level of this README, and run:

$ ../../bin/mksql3db.sh GRT.db ../GRT-transit-20110904/*

This will work out the version number from your previous GRT.db. If you don't have
one you'll get a warning or two and it will use version 1.

That will produce GRT.db.gz, with an internal version number one more than the prior
version. It will also produce GRT.db.version, a text file that is fetched by the
running app for checking if a new db is available for download (by comparing the
intenal DB version number to the one in the file).
